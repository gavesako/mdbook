# Phra Siam Ubali Mahathera "คุยไปเล่าไป | พระอุบาลีมหาเถระ | พระไทยที่คนลังกาศรัทธาที่สุด Part 1" 

The video provides a historical account of how a delegation of Thai monks, led by Phra Ubali Maha Thera, traveled from Siam (Ayutthaya) to Sri Lanka (Lanka) in the 18th century to restore the Buddhist monastic lineage.

The Crisis in Sri Lanka
 * Decline of the Sasana: After centuries of glory, the Buddhist monastic order in Sri Lanka faced near extinction, fulfilling the Buddhist prophecy of the religion's eventual decline [00:46].
 * Foreign Occupation: Starting around 1953 B.E. (1410 C.E.), foreign powers, particularly the Portuguese, began to occupy the island. The Portuguese aggressively enforced Roman Catholicism, leading to the destruction of temples and the killing or forced disrobing of monks [06:05].
 * Near Extinction: Monks were forced to hide in the central mountainous region of Kandy or reduce their practice to living like lay people with only eight precepts [07:13]. By the time the Dutch (Hollanda) took over, there were virtually no fully ordained monks left in the entire country [08:43].
The Quest for Revival
 * The Last Novice: The sole remaining figure attempting to preserve the religion was Samanera Saranangkara (Novice Saranangkara), who was an elderly novice (around 54 or 64 years old) desperate for full ordination (Upasampada) [09:06].
 * Request to Siam: In 2293 B.E. (1750 C.E.), King Kirti Sri Rajasingha of Kandy, advised by Saranangkara, sent envoys to Siam (Ayutthaya) to ask for fully ordained monks. They needed monks who were experts in the Vinaya (monastic discipline) to properly conduct ordination ceremonies and re-establish the monastic boundaries (Sima) [12:45].
The Mission of Phra Ubali Maha Thera
 * The Chosen Monk: Phra Ubali Maha Thera, who was a high-ranking monk at Wat Thammaram in Ayutthaya and an expert in Vinaya (implied by his title), volunteered for the perilous mission [16:13].
 * First Attempt Fails: Phra Ubali and his delegation of 18 monks and 7 novices embarked on their journey in 2294 B.E. (1751 C.E.), sent off personally by King Borommakot [18:46]. However, their ship was wrecked in a great storm, forcing them to turn back to Ayutthaya in disappointment [20:01].
 * Second Attempt and Arrival: Almost a year later, the group made a second attempt, this time traveling on a Dutch ship. After a difficult five-month sea voyage, they arrived at Trincomalee port in Sri Lanka in 2296 B.E. (1753 C.E.) [21:24].
 * Emotional Reunion: The journey from the coast to Kandy was a long, arduous 11-day trek [22:22]. Samanera Saranangkara, burning with anticipation, traveled to meet Phra Ubali. Upon meeting the Thai delegation, the novice prostrated and wept, expressing his profound relief that the monastic lineage would now be saved [24:12].
The Restoration and Legacy
 * The First Ordination: King Kirti Sri Rajasingha designated a Royal Garden, which became Wat Malwatta (Bupharam Temple), as the site for the ordinations [26:17]. Phra Ubali re-established the Sima boundary and, after demonstrating the correct procedure on a Thai novice, he fully ordained Samanera Saranangkara and six other Lankan novices [27:08].
 * The Siam Nikaya: The King celebrated this momentous occasion with cannon fire and announced the firm establishment of Buddhism in Lanka [27:27]. This event marked the beginning of the Syamavamsa or Siam Nikaya (Siam Sect), which remains the largest and most influential monastic order in Sri Lanka today [27:52].
 * Hard Work: Phra Ubali spent three years on the island, facing challenges such as teaching the Lankan monks the Khmer script used in the Thai scriptures and altering the old tradition of ordination by conducting the ceremony on permanent land-based chapels [28:19]. During his time, he ordained over 700 monks and 3,000 novices [29:12].
 * Death on Duty: Phra Ubali Maha Thera passed away on March 16, 2298 B.E. (1755 C.E.), at Wat Bupharam, before the second Thai delegation could arrive. He is remembered as a Dhammaduta (Dharma messenger) who died while fulfilling his sacred duty [30:54].
 * Lasting Impact: Phra Ubali is highly revered in Sri Lanka, where his story is included in the history curriculum [30:26]. He is also credited with advising the King to make the annual Kandy Esala Perahera (Tooth Relic procession) a public event for mass veneration [34:04].
